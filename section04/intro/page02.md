4. isEmpty()?: Checking if the stack is empty
5. size()?: Returning the number of items inside

is the size fixed?
what to return when empty?

## Built-in classes vs Using Arrays as stacks

[Java Stack](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-stack)
[Stack in C++](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-in-cpp-stl/)

If no built-in class, we can implement a Stack class or use an array as a stack

```js
var stack = [];
```
