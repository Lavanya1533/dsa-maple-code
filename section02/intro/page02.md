# How to evaluate codes

- Clean Code
  - Readability
  - Namings
  - Indentations
  - Separation of Concerns (SoC): writing small functions
- Question-based
  - Covering all/edge cases
  - Formatting data
  - Verifying inputs
  - Consistent output format

## Complexities

Rough estimation about the time and memory usages as a function of input sizes

Input => Complexity
n => O(n^2)
m,n => O(mn)

- Time Complexity: How much time it takes
- Memory/Space Complexity: How much memory it uses

Our goal is to minimize time complexity most of the time.
When asked "what is the complexity?", they mean the time complexity.
